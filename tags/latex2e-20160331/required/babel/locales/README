These files are for testing and discussion. Their exact contents, key
names, etc., are provisional and some of them will change.

Most of data has been extracted from CLDR. For further info and

Interestingly, there are some missing languages in CLDR. Therefore,
the ini file is incomplete.

Other parts are taken from the corresponding style files for
babel and polyglossia, under LPPL.
