\section{\hologo{LuaTeX} support}

This release refines the \hologo{LuaTeX} support introduced in the
2015/10/01 release. A number of patches have been added to improve the
behavior of \package{ltluatex}, and the kernel code has been adjusted to
allow for changes in \hologo{LuaTeX} v0.85--v0.87. Most notably, newer
\hologo{LuaTeX} releases allow more than $16$ write streams and these are now
enabled for use by \verb|\newwrite|.

\section{Unicode data}

As noted in \LaTeX{} News~22, the 2015/01/01 release of \LaTeX{} introduced
built-in support for extended \TeX{} systems. In particular, the kernel now
loads appropriate data from the Unicode Consortium to set \verb|\lccode|,
\verb|\uccode|, \verb|\catcode| and \verb|\sfcode| values in an automated
fashion for the entire Unicode range.

The initial approach taken by the team was to incorporate the existing model
used by (plain) \hologo{XeTeX} and to pre-process the ``raw'' Unicode data into
a ready-to-use form as \verb|unicode-letters.def|. However, the relationship
between Unicode Consortium and \TeX{} data structures is non-trivial and still
being explored. As such, it is preferable to directly parse the original
(\verb|.txt|) files at point of use. The team have therefore ``spun-out'' both
the data and the loading to a new generic package, \package{unicode-data}. This
package makes the original Unicode Consortium data files available in the
\verb|texmf| tree (in \verb|tex/generic/unicode-data|) and provides generic
loaders suitable for reading this data into the plain, \LaTeXe{} and other
formats.

At present, the following data files are included in this new package:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb|CaseFolding.txt|
  \item \verb|EastAsianWidth.txt|
  \item \verb|LineBreak.txt|
  \item \verb|MathClass.txt|
  \item \verb|SpecialCasing.txt|
  \item \verb|UnicodeData.txt|
\end{itemize}
These files are used either by \LaTeXe{} or by \package{expl3}
(\emph{i.e.}~they represent the set currently required by the team). The
Unicode Consortium provide various other data files and we are happy to add
these to the generic package, as this is intended to provide a single place
to collect this material in the \verb|texmf| tree. Such requests can be
mailed to the team as usual or logged at the package home page:
\url{https://github.com/latex3/unicode-data}.

The new apporach extends use of Unicode data in setting \TeX{} information
in two ways. First, the \verb|\sfcode| of all end-of-quotation/closing
punctuation is now st to $0$ (transparent to \TeX{}). Second, \verb|\Umathcode|
values are now set using \verb|MathClass.txt| rather than setting up only
letters (which was done using an arbitrary plane~$0$/ plane~$1$ separation).

For \hologo{XeTeX}, users should note that \verb|\xtxHanGlue| and
\verb|\xtxHanSpace| are \emph{no longer defined}, and no assignments are made
to \verb|\XeTeXinterchartoks|. The values which were previously inherited from
the plain \hologo{XeTeX} set up files are \emph{not} suitable for properly
typestting east Asian text. There are third-party packages addressing this
area well, notable those in the \package{CTeX} bundle.
