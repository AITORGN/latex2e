\section{\eTeX{}}

In \LaTeX{} News~16 (December 2003) the team announced
\begin{quotation}
We expect that within the next two years, releases of \LaTeX{} will
change modestly in order to run best under an extended \TeX{} engine
that contains the \eTeX{} primitives, e.g., \eTeX{} or pdf\TeX{}.
\end{quotation}
and also said
\begin{quotation}
Although the current release does not \emph{require} \eTeX{} features, we
certainly recommend using an extended \TeX{}, especially if you need to debug
macros. \end{quotation}

For many years the team have worked on the basis that users will have \eTeX{}
available but had not revisited the above statements formally. As of the
January 2017 release of \LaTeXe{}, \eTeX{} is \emph{required} to build the
format, and attempting to build a format without the extensions will fail.

Practically, modern \TeX{} distributions provide the extensions in all engines
other than the ``pure'' Knuth \texttt{tex}, and indeed parts of the
format-building process already require \eTeX{}, most notably some of the UTF-8
hyphenation patterns. As such, there should be no noticeable affect on users of
this change.

The team expect to make wider use of \eTeX{} within the kernel in future;
details will be announced where they impact on end users in a visible way.
