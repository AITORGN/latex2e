\section{\LaTeX{} table columns with fixed widths}

Frank published a short paper in in
TUGBoat~\cite{Mittelbach:TB38-2-213} on producing tables that have
columns with fixed widths. The outlined approach using column
specifiers ``\texttt{w}'' and ``\texttt{W}'' has now been integrated
into the \pkg{array} package.
