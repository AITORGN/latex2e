\section{Scheduled \LaTeX\ bug-fix release}

This issue of \LaTeX~News marks the second bug-fix release of
\LaTeXe\ since shifting to a new build system in 2009.
Provided sufficient changes are made, we expect to
repeat such releases yearly or bi-yearly to stay in sync with \TeX\ Live.

\section{Continued development}

\begin{itshape} % still from ltnews20

The \LaTeXe\ kernel is no longer being actively developed, as any non-negligible changes now could have dramatic backwards compatibility issues with old documents. Similarly, new features cannot be added to the kernel since any new documents written now would then be incompatible with legacy versions of \LaTeX{} of which there are many in the fields.

The situation on the package level is quite different though. While most of us have stopped developing packages for \LaTeXe{} there are many contributing developers that continue to enrich \LaTeXe{} by providing or extending add-on packages with new or better functionality.

However, the \LaTeX\ team certainly recognises that there are improvements to be made to the kernel code; over the last few years we have been working on building, expanding, and solidifying the \textsf{expl3} programming layer for future \LaTeX\ development. We are using \textsf{expl3} to build new interfaces for package development and tools for document design. Progress here is continuing.

\section{Release notes}

In addition to a few small documentation fixes, the following changes have been made to the \LaTeXe\ code; in accordance with the philosophy of minimising forwards and backwards compatibility problems, most of these will not be noticeable to the regular \LaTeX\ user.
