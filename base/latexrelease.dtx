% \subsection{New Allocation Code}
% Previously |\newcount| and related commands were based on classic
% TeX and only allocated in the range 0--255. This was extended (in
% different ways) for e-\TeX\ in the |etex| package and in the
% |xelatex.ini| and |lualatex.ini| files used in those
% formats. Related to this the number of boxes allocated to store
% floats was limited. This was extended to a certain extent in the
% |morefloats| package (by xx and xx) but the new allocation
% incorporates float allocation directly and supports much larger
% float lists using the extended registers.
%
% The new code allocates registers in the full extended range (
% $2^{15}-1$ for etex and xelatex, $2^{16}-1$ for lualatex.
% In addition a new command |\extrafloats| is provided, to be documented\ldots
%
% |\newmarks| and |\newXeTeXintercharclass| \ldots

% in two-column page style, a single-column figure can come before
% an earlier double-column figure, and vice versa."
%
% this twocolumn behavior is undesireable---at least by me and
% most professional organizations i publish in.  ed snyzter developed
% a hack fix for 2.09 several years ago which links the two
% counters, but i have not run across a similar "fix" for 2e...
% \end{verbatim}
%
% Originally fixed in package \Lpack{fix2col} which was merged into

% merged into this file.
%
% \subsubsection{Notes on the Implementation Strategy}
%
% The standard output routine maintains two lists of floats that have
% been `deferred' for later consideration. One list for single column
% floats, and one for double column floats (which are always
% immediately put onto their deferred list). This mechanism means
% that \LaTeX\ `knows' which type of float is contained in each box
% by the list that it is processing, but having two lists means
% that there is no mechanism for preserving the order between the
% floats in each list.
%
% The solution to this problem consists of two small changes to
% the output routine.
%
% Firstly, abandon the `double column float list' |\@dbldeferlist|
% and change every command where it is used so that instead the
% same |\@deferlist| is used as for single column floats.
% That one change ensures that double and single column floats
% stay in the same sequence, but as \LaTeX\ no longer `knows'
% whether a float is double or single column, it will happily
% insert a double float into a single column, overprinting the
% other column, or the margin.
%
% The second change is to provide an alternative mechanism for
% recording the two column floats. \LaTeX\ already has a compact
% mechanism for recording float information, an integer count register
% assigned to each float records information about the `type' of float
% `figure', `table' and the position information `htp' etc.
%
% The type information is stored in the `high' bits, one bit position
% (above `32') allocated to each float type. The `low' bits store
% information about the allowed positions, one bit each allocated for
% |h t b p|.  In the \LaTeX2.09 system, the bit corresponding to `16'
% formed a `boundary' between these two sets of information, and it
% was never actually used by the system. Ed Sznyter's
% \package{fixfloats} package not unreasonably used this position to
% store the double column information, setting the bit for double
% column floats. Then at each point in the output routine at which a
% float is committed to a certain region, an additional check must be
% made to check that the float is (or is not) double column. If it
% spans the wrong number of columns it is deferred rather than being
% added.
%
% Unfortunately the bit `16' is not available in \LaTeXe. It is used
% to encode the extra float position possibility `|!|' that was added
% in that system. It would be possible to use position `32' and to
% move the flags for `table', `figure',\ldots\ up one position, to
% start at 64, but this would mean that in principle one less float
% type would be supported, and more importantly is likely to break
% any other packages that assume anything about the output routine
% internals. So here I instead use another mechanism for flagging
% double column floats: By default all floats have depth 0pt.
% This package arranges that double column ones have depth 1sp.
% This information may then be used in the same manner as in
% the \package{fixfloats} package, to defer any floats that are not of
% the correct column spanning type.
%
%
%
% \subsection{Infinite glue found (pr/4023 and pr/2346)}
%
% The fix for pr/2346 had an issue when used in conjunction with
%  |\enlargethispage| as the latter introduced an infinite negative
%  glue at the bottom of the page. That in turn make a |\vsplit|
%  operation to get at the column marks invalid.
%

% >Originator:     daniel@cs.uni-bonn.de (Daniel Reischert)
% >Description:
% When setting the document in two columns
% the headline shows the top mark of the second column,
% but it should show the top mark of the first column.
% \end{verbatim}
%
% Originally fixed in package \Lpack{fix2col} which was merged into
% this package. Documentation and code from this package have been
% merged into this file.
%
% \subsubsection{Notes on the Implementation Strategy}
%
% The standard \LaTeX\ twocolumn system works internally by making
% each column a separate `page' that is passed independently to \TeX's
% pagebreaker. (Unlike say the \package{multicol} package, where all
% columns are gathered together and then split into columns later,
% using |\vsplit|.) This means that the primitive \TeX\ marks that are
% normally used for header information, are globally reset after the
% first column. By default \LaTeX\ does nothing about this.
% A good solution is provided by Piet van Oostrum (building on earlier
% work of Joe Pallas) in his \package{fixmarks} package.
%
% After the first column box has been collected the mark information
% for that box is saved, so that any |\firstmark| can be
% `artificially' used to set the page-level marks after the second
% column has been collected. (The second column |\firstmark| is not
% normally required.) Unfortunately \TeX\ does not provide a direct
% way of knowing if any marks are in the page, |\firstmark| always has a
% value from previous pages, even if there is no mark in this page.
% The solution is to make a copy of the box and then |\vsplit| it
% so that any marks show up as |\splitfirstmark|.
%
% The use of |\vsplit| does mean that the output routine will globally
% change the value of |\splitfirstmark| and
% |\splitbotmark|. The \package{fixmarks} package goes to some trouble
% to save and restore these values so that the output routine does
% \emph{not} change the values. This part of \package{fixmarks} is not
% copied here as it is quite costly (having to be run on every page) and
% there is no reason why anyone writing code using |\vsplit| should
% allow the output routine to be triggered before the split marks have
% been accessed.

%
% Use of a \raisebox in \section{} produces the error message
% mentioned in the subject.
%
% PR latex/1738 described a similar problem, which has been solved
% 10 years ago. Protecting the \raisebox with \protect solved my
% problem as well, but wouldn't it make sense to have a similar fix
% as in the PR?
%
% It is particularly confusing, that an unprotected \raisebox in a

% produces error.

%
% While not technically a bug, in this day and age there are few
% reasons why commands taking optional arguments should not be robust.
%
% \subsubsection{Notes on the implementation strategy}
%
% Rather than changing the kernel macros to be robust, we have decided
% to add the macro \DescribeMacro{\MakeRobust}|\MakeRobust| in
% \Lpack{fixltx2e} so that users can easily turn fragile macros into
% robust ones. A macro |\foo| is made robust by doing the simple
% |\MakeRobust{\foo}|. \Lpack{fixltx2e} makes the following kernel
% macros robust: |\(|, |\)|, |\[|, |\]|,
%  |\makebox|, |\savebox|,

% >Arrival-Date:   Sat Jul 17 05:11:05 1999
% >Originator:     asnd@triumf.ca (Donald Arseneau)
% >Description:
% Just to keep in mind for further development eh?
% A page break at an \addpenalty after \vspace does *not*
% give a flush-bottom page.  (The intent of \addpenalty is
% apparently just to preserve the flush bottom by putting
% the breakpoint `above' the skip.)
%\end{verbatim}
%
% \subsection{Within counters only reset next level down (pr4393)}
%
% This is actually implicitly documented behavior in the \LaTeX{}
% Manual that states that |\stepcounter| resets all counters marked
% ``within''. However it means that if, for example, theorems are
% numbered within sections and you start a new chapter in a book, the
% section counter is reset to zero but the theorem counter is not
% until the first section appears. Thus a theorem directly within the
% chapter body (without a new section) would show an incremented
% number relative to the last theorem of the previous chapter.
%
%
% For this reason we are now resetting all levels of within in one go
% even if that means that some of these resets may happen several times
% unnecessarily.
% 
%
% \subsection{Check the optional arguments of floats}
%
% By default LaTeX silently ignores unknown letters in the optional
% arguments of floats. |\begin{figure}[tB]| the |B| is ignored so it
% acts like |\begin{figure}[t]| However |\begin{figure}[B]| does
% \emph{not} act like |\begin{figure}[]| as the check for an empty
% argument, or unsupplied argument, is earlier. |[]| causes the
% default float placement to be used, but |[B]| means that \emph{no}
% float area is allowed and so the float will not be placed until the
% next |\clearpage| or end of document, no warning is given.
%
% This package adds a check on each letter, and if it not one of
% |!tbhp| then an error is given and the code acts as if |p| had been
% used, so that the float may be placed somewhere.
%

%  \footnotemark[1] is not showing the mark number 1 but
%  the mark \value{footnote}.
%\end{verbatim}
% This bug was related to pr/3400, where |\@fnsymbol| was made robust.
%
% \subsubsection{Notes on the implementation strategy}
%
% Pr/3400 made |\@fnsymbol| decide between text-mode and math-mode,
% which requires a certain level of robustness somewhere as the
% decision between text and math must be made at typesetting time and
% not when inside |\protected@edef| or similar commands. One way of
% dealing with this is to make sure the value seen by |\@fnsymbol| is
% a fully expanded number, which could be handled by code such as
% \begin{verbatim}
% \def\fnsymbol#1{\expandafter\@fnsymbol
%   \expandafter{\the\csname c@#1\endcsname}}
% \end{verbatim}
% This would be a good solution if everybody used the high level
% commands only by writing code like |\fnsymbol{footnote}|. Unfortunately
% many classes (including the standard classes) and packages use the
% internal forms directly as in |\@fnsymbol\c@footnote| so the easy
% solution of changing |\fnsymbol| would break code that had worked for
% the past 20~years.
%
% Therefore the implementation here makes |\@fnsymbol| itself a
% non-robust command again and instead uses a new robust command
% \DescribeMacro{\TextOrMath}|\TextOrMath|, which will take care of
% typesetting either the math or the text symbol. In order to do so,
% we face an age old problem and unsolvable problem in \TeX: A
% reliable test for math mode that doesn't destroy
% kerning. Fortunately this problem can be solved when using e\TeX\ so
% if you use this as engine for your \LaTeX\ format, as recommended by
% the \LaTeX3 Project, you will get a fully functioning |\TextOrMath|
% command with no side effects. If you use regular \TeX\ as engine for
% your \LaTeX\ format then we have to choose between the lesser of two
% evils: 1)~breaking ligatures and preventing kerning or 2)~face the
% risk of choosing text-mode at the beginning of an alignment cell,
% which was supposed to be math-mode. We have decided upon 1) as is
% customary for regular robust commands in \LaTeX.
